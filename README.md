# Draft-It

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application will be used for setting up Magic the Gathering drafts online with other users. By creating or joining lobbies you will interface with the application to select cards from a set of packs that are decided by the host, following typical pack rules from the draft boosters of the respective set. Rarities, pull odds, and how the packs are filled will all be maintained as per real life pack rules.

The application will present you with the cards in the pack, from which you will choose one, and then the rest of the cards will be given to the next user in current order. After repeating until the last card in the pack is picked, the next pack will repeat the process in reverse turn order, and then the last pack in original turn order. Each user will then be given the option to export their created card list to MTGA, MTGO, or just copy to clipboard. 


## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Despite the abundance of playing platforms for Magic the Gathering, some of the most popular formats of the game are only incorporated in fan made platforms, or not at all. One of these examples is a MTG draft, one of the core foundations of the game, something local game stores fill up every friday night for. Despite it's popularity, drafting online has few viable or well put together options. By drafting in real time using an inuitive and clear system, and then exporting the draft to another platform of choice to play on, users will be able to enjoy drafting even when budget or personal constraints would otherwise not permmit.

### Design

Above is a picture of what the main HTML page will look like, below is a diagram of how users will interact with the website, and the website and server will interact.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses proper HTML structure for application. 6 HTML pages. One for login, one for main page, one for lobby waiting room, one for drafting, one for deck storage, one for the deck list.
- **CSS** - Application styling using neutral colors to not inhibit card visibility, mainly designed for desktop experience, good levels of reading.
- **React** - Provides login, card choice and display, routing using React and JavaScript.
- **Service** - Backend service for:
    - draft creation/joining
    - draft card list storage
    - retrieving card lists
    - displaying cards using [Scryfall API](https://api.scryfall.com)
- **DB/Login** - Store users and card lists in database, register and login users, securely store credentials, authenticate users before draft elegible.
- **WebSocket** - As each user picks cards the remaining cards from that pack are sent to the next user.
